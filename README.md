```
# How to check if it works

  Checking AdGuardHome...              alive.
```
# How to report issue:
I need following directory:
```
/opt/etc/AdGuardHome
/jffs/scripts/dnsmasq.postconf
```
One can use this command to create a tar archive of these files:
```
echo .config > exclude-files; tar -cvf AdGuardHome.tar -X exclude-files /opt/etc/AdGuardHome /jffs/scripts/dnsmasq.postconf; rm exclude-files
```
in current directory and send me the archive for debug.
I also need following information:
- Which dns server you selected during AdGuardHome installation
- Which router you're using
- Firmware and its version
# How I made this:
- Use AdGuardHome binary packages from https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome
- I wrote the installer script with stuff inspired from entware-setup.sh from asuswrt-merlin
- You can look at all the stuff here https://github.com/jumpsmm7/Asuswrt-Merlin-AdGuardHome-Installer
