To use a workflow, you can utilize either of the following steps:

- Run the `/setup-github` command in Gemini CLI on your terminal to set up workflows for your repository.
- Copy the workflow files into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

## Customizing Workflows

Gemini CLI workflows are highly configurable. You can adjust their behavior by editing the corresponding `.yml` files in your repository.

For detailed configuration options, including Gemini CLI settings, timeouts, and permissions, see our [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md).
