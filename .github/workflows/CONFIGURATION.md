## How to Configure Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI workflows are highly configurable. You can adjust their behavior by editing the corresponding `.yml` files in your repository.

Gemini CLI supports many settings that control how it operates. For a complete list, see the [Gemini CLI documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/get-started/configuration.md#available-settings-in-settingsjson).

### Custom Commands (TOML Files)

The example workflows use custom commands defined in TOML files to provide specialized prompts for different tasks. These TOML files are automatically installed from the action's `.github/commands/` directory to `.gemini/commands/` when the workflow runs.

**Available custom commands:**

- `/gemini-invoke` - General-purpose AI assistant for code changes and analysis
- `/gemini-review` - Pull request code review
- `/gemini-triage` - Single issue triage
- `/gemini-scheduled-triage` - Batch issue triage

**How it works:**

1. The action copies TOML files from `.github/commands/` to `.gemini/commands/` during workflow execution
2. Workflows reference these commands using the `prompt` input (e.g., `prompt: '/gemini-invoke'`)
3. The Gemini CLI loads the command's prompt from the TOML file

**Customizing commands:**

To customize the prompts for your repository:

1. Copy the TOML file(s) from `examples/workflows/<workflow-name>` to your repository's `.gemini/commands/` directory
2. Modify the `prompt` field in the TOML file to match your needs
3. Commit the TOML files to your repository

For example, to customize the PR review prompt:

```bash
mkdir -p .gemini/commands
cp examples/workflows/pr-review/gemini-review.toml .gemini/commands/
# Edit .gemini/commands/gemini-review.toml as needed
git add .gemini/commands/gemini-review.toml
git commit -m "feat: customize PR review prompt"
```

The workflow will use your custom TOML file instead of the default one from the action.

### Key Settings

#### Conversation Length (`model.maxSessionTurns`)

This setting controls the maximum number of conversational turns (messages exchanged) allowed during a workflow run.

**Default values by workflow:**

| Workflow                             | Default `model.maxSessionTurns` |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| [Issue Triage](./issue-triage)       | 25                              |
| [Pull Request Review](./pr-review)   | 20                              |
| [Gemini CLI Assistant](./gemini-cli) | 50                              |

**How to override:**

Add the following to your workflow YAML file to set a custom value:

```yaml
with:
  settings: |-
    {
      "model": {
        "maxSessionTurns": 10
      }
    }
```

#### Allowlist Tools (`tools.core`)

Allows you to specify a list of [built-in tools] that should be made available to the model. You can also use this to allowlist commands for shell tool.

**Default:** All tools available for use by Gemini CLI.

**How to configure:**

Add the following to your workflow YAML file to specify core tools:

```yaml
with:
  settings: |-
    {
      "tools": {
        "core": [
          "list_directory",
          "read_file",
          "grep_search",
          "run_shell_command(echo)"
        ]
      }
    }
```

#### MCP Servers (`mcpServers`)

Configures connections to one or more Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for discovering and using custom tools. This allows you to extend Gemini CLI GitHub Action with additional capabilities.

**Default:** Empty

**Example:**

```yaml
with:
  settings: |-
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e",
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

### Custom Context and Guidance (`GEMINI.md`)

To provide Gemini CLI with custom instructions—such as coding conventions, architectural patterns, or other guidance—add a `GEMINI.md` file to the root of your repository. Gemini CLI will use the content of this file to inform its responses.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Settings

### Setting Timeouts

You can control how long Gemini CLI runs by using either the `timeout-minutes` field in your workflow YAML, or by specifying a timeout in the `settings` input.

### Required Permissions

Only users with the following roles can trigger the workflow:

- Repository Owner (`OWNER`)
- Repository Member (`MEMBER`)
- Repository Collaborator (`COLLABORATOR`)
