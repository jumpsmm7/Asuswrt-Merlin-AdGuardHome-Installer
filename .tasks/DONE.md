## TASK-001: Establish DNS lifecycle baseline
**Priority:** P1 | **Tags:** dns, lifecycle

Part 1 of the six-part implementation. Keep changes off master; commit and validate separately.

### Checkpoint

- Development branch created from origin/master at e3866c4.
- Original handoff failure diagnosed as non-root fixture ownership; unchanged dash test passes in a root-mapped namespace.
- BusyBox netstat, startup readiness, adaptive dnsmasq readiness and Local Cache save-failure tests pass. Extended lifecycle tests are being checked separately.
- Expected behavior and pending router checks recorded in docs/dns-lifecycle-validation.md.

## TASK-002: Default to refuse-unknown on install and upgrade
**Priority:** P1 | **Tags:** dns, lifecycle

Part 2 of the six-part implementation. Keep changes off master; commit and validate separately.

### Checkpoint

- Missing install/upgrade policies default to refusal; explicit 0/1 and both CLI selections tested. Upgrade and migration regressions pass. Checksums regenerated.

## TASK-003: Identify managed main and SDN dnsmasq instances
**Priority:** P1 | **Tags:** dns, lifecycle

Part 3 of the six-part implementation. Keep changes off master; commit and validate separately.

### Checkpoint

- Read-only managed detection tests pass under BusyBox ash: main and multiple SDN PIDs, alternate display names, duplicate sockets, unknown/stale PIDs, unsupported firmware, foreign configs, scoped listeners and symlinks. Runtime syntax passes.

## TASK-004: Coordinate DNS handoff and recovery
**Priority:** P1 | **Tags:** dns, lifecycle

Part 4 of the six-part implementation. Keep changes off master; commit and validate separately.

### Checkpoint

- Managed owner escalation revalidates PID/config identity; replacement main and SDN listeners are checked with bounded retries. Multi-SDN lifecycle, existing handoff, WAN/LAN lifecycle, netstat, dnsmasq publication and permission tests pass under BusyBox 1.30. Firmware ALL_SDN dispatch documented; hardware checks remain pending.
